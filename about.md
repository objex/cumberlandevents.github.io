Cumberland.events is free for people to create internal/external events, showing times and information for anybody that wants to attend.

# The Problem I was trying to solve

The main problem I found was that there was no **single** website to see what is on in Cumberland, events that are coming up or have already gone, so I created [cumberland.events](http://cumberland.events)
