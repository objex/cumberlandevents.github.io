Canada 150 Celebrations In Cumberland Ontario

In 2017, Canada will celebrate its 150th birthday. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Cumberland Community Association, Cumberland Lions Club and Cumberland Farmers’ Market plan to mark this milestone together with a Canada 150 celebrations on July 1st, 2017. 

On behalf of all four organizations, we extend this invitation to you to attend this special event. 

The planning committee, consisting of volunteers from all four organizations, are working hard in planning and fundraising for this grand celebration. It has given us all the opportunity to renew and secure old friendships and make new bonds along the way, as we work together, side by side, to celebrate Canada’s milestone anniversary. 

The festivities will begin with an opening ceremony with your honoured presence along with speeches from other guests and sponsors. We will have activities for kids, displays and booths set up from different communities and commercial organizations with a complimentary BBQ for everyone. 

We hope this event will be an excellent opportunity to re-establish old friendships and make new bonds with our neighbours. We expect that many people will be joining us for the celebrations.

It would be an honour if you would join us on Saturday, July 1st at 11am at Baitun Naseer Mosque in Cumberland to celebrate this great country’s milestone. 

We look forward to your presence on Canada Day!
